            Best sweet thing to have after any meal.

        <p>This is the original, supremely rich version of the iconic molten chocolate cake, created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, preferably Valrhona</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Butter and lightly flour four 6-ounce ramekins. Tap out excess flour. Set the ramekins on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a double boiler, over simmering water, melt butter with chocolate. In a medium bowl, beat eggs with egg yolks, sugar and salt at high speed until thickened and pale.</li>
            <li>Whisk melted chocolate until smooth. Quickly fold it into egg mixture, along with flour. Spoon batter into prepared ramekins and bake for 12 minutes, or until sides of cakes are firm but centers are soft. Let cakes cool in ramekins for 1 minute, then cover each with an inverted dessert plate. Carefully turn each cake over, let stand for 10 seconds and then unmold. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
